When initiating my MetaMask account it instructed me to copy and paste my top secret passcode in the EtherWallet "To address' location but instead I pulled an Einstein and posted in my browsers "To address" location for the entire world to see. Any advice on starting fresh. I can't seem to get rid of account 1.
